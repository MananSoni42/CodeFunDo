## Features

* **Informs about the likelihood of a disaster in your area.** Users get to know how disaster-prone their current location is based on historical Data ( [like this one](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/theme/hazards/data/sets/browse) ) along with real time data gathered from various sources. ( [1](https://openweathermap.org/current), [2](http://satellite.imd.gov.in/), [3](https://navigator.eumetsat.int/start) )

* **Connects people in the face of a disaster.** People can mark themselveas safe / affected during a disaster. Our algorithm intelligently identifies safe spots within a disaster prone area and helps victims reach such areas. 

 * **Automatically raises funds for disaster victims.** Smartly recognizes when a disaster occurs from various sources like twitter, popular news articles and data collected from the users of the app. 
 As soon as a disaster is identified, Catastrofree immediately starts to raise awareness about the disaster and users all over the world have an option to contribute to donation camps/charities for the disaster.

* **Simple, beautiful and modern interface.** A minimalistic interface  that is easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

* **Detailed graphs and statistics.** Clearly see previous predictions with beautiful and detailed graphs. Scroll back to see the complete
  history of disasters in your area.

  and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the
  GPLv3.
