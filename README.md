# Catastrofree
## What is Catastrofree?
Catastrofree is a disaster management and prediction app that can save lives.
It uses a novel approach for prediction and mitigation of natural disasters.
By combining machine learning analytics and smart data collection algorithms,
Catastrofree aims to minimize loss of human life by connecting people during a disaster.
## Features:
* **Informs about the likelihood of a disaster in your area**
Users get to know how disaster-prone their current location is based on historical
Data taken along with real time weather data gathered from various sources.
* **Connects people in the face of a disaster**
People can mark themselveas safe / affected during a disaster.
Thus people can identify and prepare for a disaster much before
it actually reaches them by observing the locations of the other users.
Our algorithm intelligently identifies safe spots within a
disaster-prone area and helps victims reach these spots.
* **Automatically raises funds for disaster victims**
As soon as a disaster is identified, Catastrofree immediately starts to raise
awareness about the disaster and users all over the world have an option to contribute
to donation camps/charities for the disaster.
* **Simple, beautiful and modern interface**
A minimalistic interface that is easy to use and
follows the material design guidelines.
* **Completely ad-free and open source**
There are absolutely no advertisements in this app,
and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the
GPLv3 license.
